     <h2>Do you remember who is who or who was whose what?</h2>
     <h4>Not everything or everyone is covered still something that will elucide you to some extent and make you cognizant of the facts that eluded from your mind over the year.</h4>
     <h3>Disclaimer: I made this for myself last year because when the second season came out I was completely lost and forgot everything that happened in first season yet did not had the time and energy to rewatch the 1st season again. So to avoid that inconvenience again I decided to note down who is who and who is whose what! But some of my friends asked me to share this with them so I decided to share this with everyone that needed it. This includes my biased opinion, information and my own theories, if you do not agree with it, I completely understand and support your incongruence, it is natural to have discrepancies over opinions, so I urge you to also be considered and kind to my opinion and choose to believe otherwise. </h3>
     <p>Jonas/the Stranger/Adam(Good/Bad not revealed yet) are the same person.

     <p>Mikkel/Micheal is/are the same person. Micheal commits suicide because Jonas reveals to him that he commits suicide and writes a letter to Jonas in all the other previous cycles. So his reasons to commit suicide in the first season are unauthentic. Because then he said he is committing suicide since he cannot keep on living this false life as Micheal. But those are not his actual thoughts so that makes his character less weighted. He used to be bullied in school by his parents (Ulrich and katherina) who were not his parents yet, when he went back in past. But how did he get in the past anyway? In the second season it was revealed that another Jonas(few years older but not the strangers age) was the one that kidnapped/took him from Jonas(Youngest version) when they were running away from the cave after being advised by the White Devil/Claudia/Egon Tiedemann’s daughter/Bartosz GrandMa/ Ragina’s Mom/ Aleksander kohler/ Tiedemann mom in law. But when did the loop start? Why did it start? And most of all how? Because someone needed to take Mikkel inside the cave in the 1st cycle. But then Jonas wouldn’t have existed in the 1st cycle because Mikkel didn’t travel back in the past yet. Because there wouldn’t have been a Mikkel turned to Micheal then, which means no Micheal no Jonas(because Micheal is Jonas Dad and it’s not possible to exist as the current biological entity as he is without Micheal). So how did this thing start?</p>  
     <p>Hanaah cheated Micheal with Ulrich(who is also her father in law), went back 33 years and met imprisoned Ulrich(He went back in time to find Mikkel but I forgot how he ended up in prison in the first place, in second season it seemed that he is being accused of murdering some children(?) I am not sure if that is a false accusation, need to ask someone or look for clips or just watch the season again but when he went back in time in the s1 he encountered Agnes his young Grandma and Tronte Nielsen his tiny dad) to prove Katherina(Ulrich’s wife/Mikkel’s mom/Hanaah’s mom in law/Jona’s Grandma), that Ulrich would choose her over katherina and their children? How effed upped is that? When she asked Ulrich, he said he would choose Hannah over them but she realizes he’s just saying those as empty words because he also figured out that Hannah had malice intention. So she leaves Ulrich to rot in there and go and flirts with Egon Tiedemann(white devils father, then a cop but now old and dead/killed by his daughter Claudia*who is later to become the white devil* when Egon expresses his desire to go to the cave because old imprisoned Ulrich again told him about it and he finally suspects about time travel and Claudia being involved and tries to call the police station to search the cave/nuclear power plant and had a little jostle with Claudia who tried to snatch the phone and bam…dead ).</p>
     <p>Martha is Jonas’s girlfriend(Cheated  her boyfriend Bartosz)? I mean they haven’t declared but they both likes each other but she is also his aunt, lol. Adam oldest Jonas kills her in front of Jonas and later another Martha shows up, who’s probably from another dimension or universe because when Jonas ask her “what time are you from?” she replies with “The question is where”. Then pulls up something (more technologically advance time machine?) that might have helped the escape the apocalypse.</p>
     <p>Charlotte who is married to Peter Doppler who is handsome af and also gay, is mother of Elisabeth who is also the mother of Charlotte? WTF! Like seriously dude WTF?! So when charlotte was in the Nuclear plant trying to stop the police guy from digging up Radioactive waste hazard, Elisabeth was in the bunker(the safe place) with her father, Ragina(Claudia daughter/ Bartosz’s mother) and the white devil(then Claudia), where young Noah arrives(Older Noah got killed by Adam but of course young Noah doesn’t know that) and saw Elisabeth who is be her wife(?) or just someone who he has a baby with aka Charlotte. OH MY GOD!  At the same time Charlotet got to see much older Elisabeth(The solider from the after apocalypse time) when the Radioactive waste turns into Time Travelling vessel since older Elisabeth was also at the end of other time travelling vessel from the after apocalypse era(This machine/vessel Is also the one through which Jonas got back from that era to 1921 also from 1921 to present day time). But how did she/Elisabeth become a solider? When did she and Noah have a baby? And how did baby charlotte end up with her grandpa who she grew up with? Clearly Noah didn’t know Charlotte was his daughter until after second season, so who brought her there? And Elisabeth didn’t seem to know her mother is actually her daughter. Oh God what is this?!</p>   
     <p>Magnus, his girlfriend/Elisabeth’s sister Franziska Doppler and Bartosz is saved by older Jonas/ stranger by helping them escape the apocalypse. Oh Magnus and Franziska (both older) is also in 1921 with Adam.</p></main>
